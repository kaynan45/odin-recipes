Image height and width:

By default, an <img> element’s height and width values will be the same as the actual image file’s height and width.
 If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions,
  you would use a value of “auto” for the height property and adjust the width value:

img {
  height: auto;
  width: 500px;
}
