        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li>Preheat the Grill:</li>
          <p>
            Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat. If you're using
            a stovetop grill pan, heat it over medium-high heat.
          </p>

          <li>Season the Chicken:</li>
          <p>
            While the grill is heating, season the boneless, skinless chicken
            breasts with your choice of herbs and spices. You can create a
            simple seasoning mix by combining salt, pepper, garlic powder, and
            paprika. Rub the seasoning onto both sides of the chicken.
          </p>

          <li>Oil the Grill:</li>
          <p>
            Once the grill is hot, brush it with a little olive oil to prevent
            the chicken from sticking.
          </p>

          <li>Grill the Chicken:</li>
          <p>
            Place the seasoned chicken breasts on the grill. Grill for about 6-7
            minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches
            165°F (74°C) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center. The
            cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken
            breasts.
          </p>

          <li>Serve:</li>
          <p>
            Once the chicken is fully cooked and has beautiful grill marks,
            remove it from the grill. Let it rest for a few minutes before
            serving.
          </p>

          <li>Prepare the Sides:</li>
          <p>
            While the chicken is resting, prepare your side dishes. Steam some
            vegetables and cook brown rice according to package instructions.
          </p>

          <li>Enjoy:</li>
          <p>
            Serve the grilled chicken breast with steamed vegetables and a
            portion of brown rice. This balanced meal provides the essential
            nutrients needed for muscle growth and recovery.
